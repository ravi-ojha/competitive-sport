take a vector array of size 10
i.e. vector<int> v[10]

lets store given string in s[]

Now vector v is used to store indexes of occurence of digits in s[]

for eg: 90460929

then 

v[0] = [1,4]
v[1] = []
v[2] = [7]
v[3] = []
...
v[9] = [0,5,7]

I hope use of vector v is clear now.

Now as we do in BFS, take a fifo queue and visited[] array.
push the first index i.e. 0 in queue and mark visited[0] as visited

We need one more array which will store the number of jumps required to move from one particular position to other.
So declare one array[100001] and mark a[0] = 0

Now we can run the BFS over the vector v i.e. while (queue is not empty) {}
Also note that if we are at index i, we can also move to i+1 and i-1. So take care of that too in this BFS

Try it out. I know, my explanation was very blur but graph is something we have to feel.
